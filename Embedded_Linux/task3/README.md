# Customizing ARM Toolchain

This file provides instructions on how to customize an ARM toolchain for your specific development needs.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Git
- Crosstool-ng

## Sysroot
<br>
<br>
### Definition

Sysroot is a directory holding a minimal filesystem for the target environment in embedded Linux development.

### Purpose

- Isolates target environment from the host.
- Enables cross-compilation by providing target-specific files.
- Manages dependencies to avoid library mismatches.

### Example

If you are developing for an ARM-based embedded system on an x86 host, the sysroot would contain ARM-specific libraries and headers.

## Binutils

### Definition

Binutils is a collection of binary utilities for manipulating object files, executables, and libraries.

### Components

- Assembler (as): Translates assembly code to machine code.
- Linker (ld): Links object files into executables or libraries.
- Binary Utilities (objcopy, objdump, readelf, etc.): Tools for binary file manipulation and analysis.

### Example

- Using the linker (ld) to combine object files into an executable: `ld -o output_executable input_file1.o input_file2.o`.
- Employing objcopy to copy sections from one binary to another: `objcopy --input-target=binary --output-target=ihex input.bin output.hex`.

In summary, sysroot provides an isolated target environment for cross-compilation, while Binutils offers essential tools like the linker and binary utilities for compiling, linking, and manipulating binary files in embedded Linux development.
